	<p> During my CS1 experience so far, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. The two websites are very interesting, but very different. To me, CSS seems a lot simpler. I started my website, and have even used terminal a couple times, which I found pretty fascinating. Inside the code of my website, I have compiled a couple different images and links, one of them being the link to my journal, which you are reading right now. I am excited for what CS1 has in store for me next! </p>
