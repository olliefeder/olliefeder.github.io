	Entry 1:

	During my CS1 experience so far, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. The two websites are very interesting, but very different. To me, CSS seems a lot simpler. I started my website, and have even used terminal a couple times, which I found pretty fascinating. Inside the code of my website, I have compiled a couple different images and links, one of them being the link to my journal, which you are reading right now. I am excited for what CS1 has in store for me next!

	Right now, I am trying to convert the homepage of my website into a gif. It's pretty complicated and I have just been trying different things to see if they work. Although it doesn;t look exactly the way I want it to right now, I'm making progress. Finally, I'm pondering ideas for the gift project, which I'm excited for; it seems very interesting!

	This week, I, along with two of my peers, created a group animation project. We chose to animate three pictures of a very famous basketball sequence because we share a common love for the sport, and I was pretty satifsied with the work we did. I learned to create loops, got more practice centering images, and played around with backgrounds and editing. However, I am slightly frustrated that I do not know how to animate the image so that it gets bigger, smaller, then repeats infititely all in one animation.

	This week, I learned how to create my first function. It was interesting to see the web page change after set time increments, and I did not know I was able to code something like that before. I also learned that it is possible to generate random numbers onto a website, which I thought was very interesting as well.

		Entry 5:
		This week, I made a function with an event listener. The event listener, in my codesketch, essentially listened for something called a string, in this case a click, in order to change an image. Learning this type of function was a very new, but interesting process for me. I'm excited to use event listeners in future projects, as they seem very useful.

		I am currently working on a holiday-themed project for my sister. I am working out the kinks of the project in a guess and check fashion, and am making progress! I was finally able to align two images in my desired way, and am continuing to add more detail to the project as I go along.

		Entry 7:
		I just finished making a project for my baby cousin. It was a webpage with many different colored sqaures as separate divs, and event listeners so that when the squares were clicked on, they would change to a picture of her. My goal for this project was to make something that she could play on her ipad and was simple enough for her to understand, but complex enough so that she wouldn't get bored of it after a couple of minutes. I think I accomplished what I wanted to, and am excited for my next project!

		Entry 8: 
		This week, I worked on a project for someone really close to me: Janet. I have known her since I was three months old, and wanted to make something special for her. She always asks what is going on in school, and I wanted to make a simple project for her so I could explain how it worked, and maybe she could learn to code a little herself. It is just a codesketch that revolves around a function with an event listener that changes the image on a click.

		Entry 9: 
		This week, I developed 10 questions about coding to help myself realize what I need to learn in the last quarter of the year. The questions are:

		1. Is there a function similar to a console.log that, instead of printing information in the console, actually does it on the web page?
		2. Why is a console.log actually useful in the final product of a project?
		3. What does the document.appendChild function do?
		4. Is a variable that counts the number of times you do something different from a regular variable that just stores things?
		5. Can you add an event listener for only one part of the screen, like half of it?
		6. What do booleans do?
		7. How do you call for a function, and is that different from just naming it lower in the code?
		8. How do you coordinate an event listener with an array?
		9. Is there any major difference between a for loop and an if else loop, or can you use either of them in most situations?
		10. What is the difference between the head and the body?

		Entry 10:
		This week, I developed four questions for a possible final project. I think I decided on a question, and it is: How did ideas about the first touchscreen come to exist? I'm excited about exploring this topic, and it interests me because in today's day and age, it is very difficult to live without a phone, most of which have touchscreens.
