	Entry 1:

	During my CS1 experience so far, I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS. The two websites are very interesting, but very different. To me, CSS seems a lot simpler. I started my website, and have even used terminal a couple times, which I found pretty fascinating. Inside the code of my website, I have compiled a couple different images and links, one of them being the link to my journal, which you are reading right now. I am excited for what CS1 has in store for me next!

	Right now, I am trying to convert the homepage of my website into a gif. It's pretty complicated and I have just been trying different things to see if they work. Although it doesn;t look exactly the way I want it to right now, I'm making progress. Finally, I'm pondering ideas for the gift project, which I'm excited for; it seems very interesting!

	This week, I, along with two of my peers, created a group animation project. We chose to animate three pictures of a very famous basketball sequence because we share a common love for the sport, and I was pretty satifsied with the work we did. I learned to create loops, got more practice centering images, and played around with backgrounds and editing. However, I am slightly frustrated that I do not know how to animate the image so that it gets bigger, smaller, then repeats infititely all in one animation.

	This week, I learned how to create my first function. It was interesting to see the web page change after set time increments, and I did not know I was able to code something like that before. I also learned that it is possible to generate random numbers onto a website, which I thought was very interesting as well.

		Entry 5:
		This week, I made a function with an event listener. The event listener, in my codesketch, essentially listened for something called a string, in this case a click, in order to change an image. Learning this type of function was a very new, but interesting process for me. I'm excited to use event listeners in future projects, as they seem very useful.

		I am currently working on a holiday-themed project for my sister. I am working out the kinks of the project in a guess and check fashion, and am making progress! I was finally able to align two images in my desired way, and am continuing to add more detail to the project as I go along.

		Entry 7:
		I just finished making a project for my baby cousin. It was a webpage with many different colored sqaures as separate divs, and event listeners so that when the squares were clicked on, they would change to a picture of her. My goal for this project was to make something that she could play on her ipad and was simple enough for her to understand, but complex enough so that she wouldn't get bored of it after a couple of minutes. I think I accomplished what I wanted to, and am excited for my next project!
