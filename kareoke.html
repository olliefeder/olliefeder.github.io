<center><div id="text">The sun goes down, the stars come out<br>
And all that counts is here and now<br>
My universe will never be the same<br>
I'm glad you came (Came, came, came)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
You cast a spell on me, spell on me<br>
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me<br>
And I decided you look well on me, well on me<br>
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me<br>
Turn the lights out now<br>
Now I'll take you by the hand<br>
Hand you another drink<br>
Drink it if you can<br>
Can you spend a little time?<br>
Time is slipping away<br>
Away from us, so stay<br>
Stay with me, I can make<br>
Make you glad you came<br><br>
The sun goes down, the stars come out<br>
And all that counts is here and now<br>
My universe will never be the same<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came<br><br>
You cast a spell on me, spell on me<br>
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me<br>
And I decided you look well on me, well on me<br>
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me<br><br>
Turn the lights out now<br>
Now I'll take you by the hand<br>
Hand you another drink<br>
Drink it if you can<br>
Can you spend a little time?<br>
Time is slipping away<br>
Away from us, so stay<br>
Stay with me, I can make<br>
Make you glad you came<br><br>
The sun goes down, the stars come out<br>
And all that counts is here and now<br>
My universe will never be the same<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
So glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came<br><br>
The sun goes down, the stars come out<br>
And all that counts is here and now<br>
My universe will never be the same<br>
I'm glad you came<br>
I'm glad you came</div>
